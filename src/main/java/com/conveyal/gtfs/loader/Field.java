/**
 * Field subclasses process an incoming String that represents a single GTFS CSV field value.
 * The value is validated and converted to its final format.
 * We need to propagate any validation errors up to the caller (where file, line, and column number context are known),
 * Unfortunately Java does not allow multiple return values. There are multiple options.
 * We could emulate multiple return by wrapping the resulting String in another object that combines it with an error type.
 * We could pass a list into every function and the functions could add errors to that list.
 * We could make the Field instances have state, which will also make them single-use and single-thread. They could
 * then accumulate errors as they do their work.
 * We could return an error or list of errors from functions that store the validated value into an array passed in as a parameter.
 * In all cases, to avoid enormous amounts of useless object creation we could re-use error lists and just clear them
 * before each validation operation.
 * However, within the Field implementations, we may need to call private/internal functions that also return multiple
 * values (an error and a modified value).
